As a Rails programmer, what's it like to try out Django?
</h2>
<p>I've seen many comparisons of Rails with Django, its Python counterpart.</p><h1>The Application</h1><p>I decided to use Django to write <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100724032703/http://titusd.co.uk/snape/timeline/" target="_blank">a local history application: the story of Snape in East Sussex</a>.</p><div class="flex flex-col items-center not-prose"><img src="https://blog-cms.joeyates.info/api/media/file/snape-timeline.png" alt="The public timeline" width="536" height="300"><div class="mt-1 text-sm text-gray-500 text-center">The public timeline</div></div><p>The front and of the application uses a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/wiki/Timeline" target="_blank">SIMILE timeline</a> to display dates.</p><h1>First Impressions about Django</h1><h2>Apps</h2><p>The main thing I was looking forward to while writing the app was modularity. In fact, in the and I made two apps: the specific Snape application and a generic timeline app.</p><h2>Creating the Database</h2><p>In Rails, you launch script/generate Model and you obtain a database and a series of migrations, which form a chronology of development of the database.</p><p>In Django, you describe the database fields in your <code>model.py</code> file and the run <code>manage.py syncdb</code>.</p><p>The advantage of the Django system is that the model holds authoritative information about the fields in the database.</p><p>The great disadvantage is that there are no <code>TABLE ALTER</code>ing migrations - you have to dump the table creation SQL and manually construct and run <code>TABLE ALTER</code> commands.</p><h2>Settings</h2><p>Django's settings file (<code>settings.py</code>) more or less has to be site specific. So that means you have to decide what to check in to your version control system. Some people seem to use a <code>settings.py.default</code> which they then copy to <code>settings.py</code> and alter to the needs of a specific machine.</p><p>I chose to keep site specific stuff in a set of JSON files, named after the local machine (see <a href="http://gnuvince.wordpress.com/2007/03/15/local-settings-in-django/" target="_blank">http://gnuvince.wordpress.com/2007/03/15/local-settings-in-django/</a>). It woks quite well, but in Rails as I commonly have a single development machine and a single production one, I am able to avoid the whole problem thanks to <code>config/environments/[development|production].rb</code>.</p><h2>Static Content</h2><p>There is a difference between how one handles static files in development and production. Most people seem to use a hack in the <code>urls.py</code> file, indicating where to get static content if in DEBUG mode, whereas in production mode you are supposed to set up Apache aliases for the various directories.</p><p>The logic here is that Django should not get involved in serving static content (quite rightly), but it certainly makes setup more laborious. One can achieve a happy medium in Rails using <code>X-SendFile</code> - Rails gets the request and then punts serving to Apache.</p><h2>Generating URLs</h2><p>There is an equivalent to Rails' <code>url_for</code> which is available inside Django templates, it's the filter <code>{ % url %}</code>. Unfortunately, the first time I wanted to create a URL was actually in Python code - I wanted to redirect. I was unable to find a way to use <code>url</code> from Python code. There is <code>get_absolute_url</code>, which can be implemented inside the model, but it's only for instances.</p><h1>Overall</h1><p>I think Django is fairly straightforward for the Rails programmer. The fact that you get a 'free' admin backend (similar to ActiveScaffold), is certainly handy. There are a lot of sources of online information and tutorials, so it's quite easy to get up and running. The main impression I got was of a small framework - while Rails covers a great range of functionality, I felt I came up against Django limitations rather quickly. That may be due to not looking in the right places, but my Google searches showed that a lot of other people were asking the same questions.</p>
